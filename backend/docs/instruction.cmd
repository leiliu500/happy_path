Project overview

This is a mental health application (1) general wellness (stress, anxiety, daily mood) (2) clinical support (depression, PTSD), (3) niche groups (teens, caregivers, chronic illness)
It aims for self-help guidance, crisis detection/triage, or peer-support facilitation
It supplements or collaborates with human therapists, or operate fully self-serve Examples: 
(1) AI journaling coach (CBT-based prompts, reflection)
(2) Crisis triage chatbot (detects suicidal ideation, routes to hotlines)
(3) Routine check-in agent (reminds users to take medication, tracks mood)
(4) “Companion” for loneliness (empathetic, always-on conversation)
Core Features
(1) Conversational agent (chat/text, possibly voice)
(2) Evidence-based guidance (CBT, DBT, mindfulness, psychoeducation)
(3) Mood tracking, journaling, daily check-ins
(4) Escalation protocols (flagging urgent cases to human help)
(5) Daily mood check-in (“How are you feeling today?”)
(6)Journaling prompts (“What’s one thing you’re grateful for today?”)
(7) Reflection guidance using CBT techniques
(8) Recognizes crisis language, offers hotline or escalates
(9)Summary dashboard (mood over time, journal streaks)
(10)Personalization (adapts to user’s history, needs)
(11) Data privacy, user control, and transparency


create schema for users to manage user account:
- user roles: agent, buyer, seller, admin, support
- user use username password to login
- user register via email
- add other necessary user attributes 



I want to develop a software frontend user interface running on mobile smart phone or web app. The software features: (1) Conversational agent (chat/text, possibly voice) (2) Evidence-based guidance (CBT, DBT, mindfulness, psychoeducation) (3) Mood tracking, journaling, daily check-ins (4) Escalation protocols (flagging urgent cases to human help) (5) Personalization (adapts to user’s history, needs) (6) Data privacy, user control, and transparency. Explain AI boundaries: Make it clear that the agent is NOT a human, nor a substitute for professional help. Crisis detection: Use models/tools to detect keywords/phrases indicating risk (e.g., suicidal ideation).Immediate, automated escalation: “If you are in crisis, call X hotline.” Optionally, allow user to connect to a human (counselor, volunteer, etc.). Regular audit: Human review of agent conversations (anonymized) for harmful advice.Transparency: Log and explain all agent actions; allow users to see/export/delete their data. Consent: Always get explicit consent for data storage and processing.Please design user interface flow for (1) For Anxiety: such as “Can you share what’s making you feel anxious right now?”, “How does anxiety show up in your body?”, “Would you like to try a grounding technique to help with these feelings?” (2) For Low Mood/Depression
“When did you start feeling this way?” “Are there activities that usually bring you some comfort?” “Is there something small you could do today that might lift your mood, even a little?” (3) For Stress “What’s causing you the most stress right now?” “How have you coped with stress in the past?” “Would it help to make a list of things you can and cannot control in this situation?” (4) For Trauma/PTSD: “Would you like to talk about what you’re experiencing, or focus on grounding exercises?” “Are there any places or activities that help you feel safe?” “Remember, you don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with.” Mood Tracking: Most apps offer it, but some (Headspace, Calm) focus more on mindfulness/meditation and less on data analytics.
Journaling: Many top apps integrate journaling for self-reflection, especially those with CBT underpinnings. Mindfulness: Nearly all include mindfulness. CBT Techniques: structured CBT tools and prompts. On-Demand AI Chat: offer real conversational AI, which is still a differentiator. Crisis Detection: include crisis detection/triage. Unique: target younger demographics, a gap in many others. Real-time AI chat with validated CBT approaches, Advanced analytics, Content quality and global reach, Youth engagement, community.
